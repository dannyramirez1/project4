				Alex Kelly, better known as his rap name Oliver Francis, is a rapper, producer and songwriter from Columbia, Missouri, USA. His biggest songs include “Polo Socks”, “Wwaavvyy” and “Yeenreally”. Utilizing the internet and platforms such as YouTube​ and SoundCloud​, Oliver has garnered a dedicated following and a number of 1 million+ streamed songs. As of February of 2018, Oliver had over 125K subscribers on YouTube​ and over 100K total followers on his three SoundCloud​ profiles.

						Oliver used to remix songs with Fruity Loops and released them on his SoundCloud. He would occasionally release rap songs on his first SoundCloud​, but would delete them out of anxiousness. He was in a band at first, but his band-mates did not have the same work ethic as him.After getting positive feedback for his tracks, he decided to rap more. The songs that he would remix on Fruity Loops would become the instrumentals to his tracks.

					Oliver has had an on and off girlfriend for a substantial portion of his life and he considers her to be a huge factor in her success. During one instance of them getting back together, she made an ultimatum for him to quit working as a janitor​ and get a "real" job. He complied, and the thousand dollars a week he made from it he would invest back into his music career. Every Sunday he would film a music video and at one point made an entire mixtape with his girl sleeping next to him.

						Oliver credits music videos for making him stand out. Oliver first started releasing music videos in 2015. At first, he only had 3,000 views but gained massive traction over the next few years. Oliver has had no cosigns and barely any features. He has a dedicated fan base and has an engaging relationship with his fans. Oliver calls his crew the cloudboys. Oliver considers Lil Wayne​, Chief Keef​, and Curren$y​ as influences. When he first started rapping his lyrical content was about gang-banging but he changed his lyrics overtime to more reflect his life.

						The reason I think Oliver Francis is going to blow up because his voice and style of rap can easily fit in to the radio and not just radio stations like 92.3 or 105.9 like many mainstream stations like 102.7, 103.5, and 104.3. He has songs like “AAYEAHH” and “Wwaavvyy” which could easily be hits if it had the right exposure and can be a better rapper on the radio then Drake, Kendrick Lamar, and Post Malone.
