					Juice Wrld is going to blow up because he is another young rapper and he doesn’t need any features to blow up he blew up without needing any features on his 999 EP. That whole EP was good beginning to bottom and he is one of the most consistent rappers to listen to. He is more consistent with his music like other rappers that only had one hit like Fetty Wap, Designer, ROb $tone, and Rich Homie Quan.
