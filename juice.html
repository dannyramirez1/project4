Last year, his Juice WRLD 999 EP really began racking up streams with the track "Lucid Dreams (Forget Me)" produced by Nick Mira topping 1 million listens.

					Juice WRLD has said on an interview with No Jumper, who has interviewed many up and coming artists before they blow up like Lil Yachty, xxxtentacion, Smokepurpp, Famous Dex, and Lil Xan.

				<div class="box colfive-span2">
					Juice Wrld is going to blow up because he is another young rapper and he doesn’t need any features to blow up he blew up without needing any features on his 999 EP. That whole EP was good beginning to bottom and he is one of the most consistent rappers to listen to. He is more consistent with his music like other rappers that only had one hit like Fetty Wap, Designer, ROb $tone, and Rich Homie Quan.
