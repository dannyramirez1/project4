			<div class="box five">
					Gunna has a slightly raspy, sing-rap sound, which he describes as “hood melody.” Paired with production from the likes of Wheezy, Playmakers, and TM88, his two solo projects to date consist of emotive Atlanta rap designed to carry you through darker times, to push you to go out and get it.

				<div class="box seven">
						Young Thug has served as a mentor to Gunna ever since; so far he’s brought him along on three tours, released two of his projects on the YSL label, and provided him with his first major feature on “Floyd Mayweather,” the flex-heavy and star-stacked Jeffery cut.

						He is going to blow up because he has only been rapping for two years and has a great mentor like young thug and some rappers can’t even get a feature from Young Thug he also has  been given many shoutouts over his new album from artist’s like Lil Uzi, Nav, and Metro Boomin.
