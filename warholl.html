				Warhol.ss is a young, up-and-coming rap artist. He started his rap career during his final year of high school while in Atlanta, but currently resides in Chicago. He was determined to start taking raps more seriously after being inspired groups like Pro Era and Beast Coast. While growing up, Warhol was heavily inspired by art. He and his grandfather are both painters, and his mother is a fashion designer. At the age of 10 Warhol.ss moved to Minneapolis from Chicago to stay with his father. Despite Basquiat being his favorite artist, Warhol.ss chose to base his name off of Andy Warhol, due to his belief that no one was ever able to compartmentalize Andy, and because he was able to create many timeless pieces.

					After tearing it up on SoundCloud, Warhol.ss is ready to drop his debut project, Chest Pains. On Tuesday (Feb. 13), Warhol hopped on Twitter to reveal the news to his fans. "Chest Pains is done," the rapper tweeted. The rapper also promoted the album on Instagram, writing, "CHEST PAINS SEASON IS HERE." While Warhol didn't reveal any more information about the upcoming project, he has remained busy as of late dropping new music. Last month, the rapper teamed up with producer Danny Wolf for the song "Balance" and dropped his own track, "Hate on Me." Warhol also released his Where's Warhol? EP in September. The seven-track project includes guest appearances from Rich The Kid and Jay Critch, as well as production from Staccato and ArnoldIsDead.

				What sparked Warhol to embark on a career in hip-hop was seeing Joey Badass and Pro Era on the come up when he was 16, Warhol.ss chose his moniker after Andy Warhol and tries to model his career after him. Andy Warhol refused to let people compartmentalize and define him and Warhol is attempting to take the same approach. The ss has a double meaning; first, it started out as a joke standing for no s******* then evolved to symbolize his love of cars.

					Warhol should have already blown up with the help of cole bennett who is his manager and releases all his music videos but, he hasn’t had that one blow up song. However, this song is going to come soon because his style on his songs is generally slow with a hard hitting beat in the back that could be something just to vibe too or also get hyped to and he has worked with many people like Crash Rarri, Thouxanbanfauni, and Unotheactivst who are all on this list. He is one of Chicago’s best rappers and he doesn’t follow that typical Chicago drill rap style. He is better than many chicago drill rappers and chicago rappers in general like, CDot Honcho, Vic Mensa, and Montana of 300
