					Lil Candypaint burst onto people’s radar recently with a stellar new video for “Internet Thug,” and is back on our pages to premiere some new sounds today. Featuring Never Been Average frontman LAMONT, “No Regrets” is a gritty, uptempo banger that shows off Candypaint and LAMONT’s unique sounds and styles, ultimately meshing for a knockout record.

					I first found about LilCandyPaint when I found Duwap Kaine, they were a duo that were always together and the first song I listened to by him was Internet Thug. This song is very short but, has a very different flow that is almost childish but, it works for him. He doesn’t always rap in a high pitched voice like on Seventh Sense he raps slower. The ability to rap in a high pitched voice works better than other artists that use it like Young Thug’s high pitched voice don’t work with all songs just like Lil Yachty.
