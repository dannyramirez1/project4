			Hailing from Atlanta, but falling into the so-called ‘SoundCloud rap’ scene due to his collaborations with the likes of XXXTentacion, Smokepurrp, and Wifisfuneral, Bans balances trap-rapping with a more melodic sound. Given that, it’s perhaps no surprise that he signed to Future’s Freebandz label in late 2017, which followed him dropping two EPs: Yung Bans EP and Yung Bans Vol.2.Born in 1999, Bans grew up listening to the likes of Chief Keef, Tyler, The Creator, Lil Wayne and Young Scooter. In late 2017, Bans told XXL his single “Lonely”featuring Lil Skies is “probably” his favorite song he’s made.

					Every few years, new rappers emerge from the streets of Atlanta and reprise the area’s sound with an added personal touch. In the 1990s/early 2000s, OutKast and Goodie Mob provided Southern hip-hop with soul. In the past decade, Young Thug and Future gave trap music melody. In 2017, we have Yung Bans, who is continuing in the footsteps of the latter artists, but toning down the vibe a touch. “If I ain’t good at nothin’ else, I’m good at rapping,” shares a confident Yung Bans during his recent visit to the XXLoffices. The Union City, Ga., native is part of hip-hop’s new wave—artists like Lil Skies, Trippie Redd and Young Nudy, who play on emotions over woozy, somewhat-eerie trap production.

				Bans began rapping in the sixth-grade, rhyming over instrumentals like Hustle & Flow's “Whoop That Trick” with his little brother. It was during his high school years, however, that he decided to make a career out of it, teaming up with Playboi Carti on his first viral hit, “4Tspoon.” A short while after, Yung Bans collaborated with XXXTentacion and Ski Mask The Slump God on “ILOVEITWHENTHEYRUN,” a lo-fi banger that's been streamed more than 37 million times to date. This month, the adolescent rhymer dropped not just one, but two EPs. The projects—Yung Bans and Yung Bans Vol. 2—are concise, with 12 combined tracks and features from Lil Skies and Smokepurpp.

					Yet Bans is continuing to work on his new sound, which he says is leading in the direction of his latest single, “Lonely.” “I’ve been making more stuff like that—more melodic songs; no more just trap rappin,” he explains. “I’m on some new stuff ’cause I got bored with that.” With music out on Spotify and Apple Music, Bans has already secured the bag, but for 2018, he's focused on his end game. "By the end of next year, I really wanna have my dream house [and] dream car," he says. "I just wanna be the man I envision in my brain, or very much close to accomplishing all my goals.” Most people don’t know: “My age. People probably think I’m like 20-something. I just turned 18."

						Yung Bans is going to blow up no doubt about it he has a song with xxxtentacion and ski mask the slump god which has millions of plays he also has songs with Playboi Carti and Lil Yachty which also has millions of plays. His style is so slow and just something that you can listen to at any time and he has time on his side only being 18 years old and he’s been rapping since he’s 16. Some people say he sounds like Famous Dex but, he is 100 times better than Dex because none of his songs sound the same they are all unique unlike Famous Dex who’s songs all sound exactly the same.
