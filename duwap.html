				<div class="box colfive-span2">
						The reason why he is going to blow up because he is barely 16 and blowing up already and he started when he was 15 and that was just last year and rappers that are big started even when they were older than him like Drake, A$AP Rocky, Wiz Khalifa, and Meek Mill.
