						The first song and his biggest hit is Santa which has one of the catchiest hooks you’ll ever hear and the production on his songs are also outstanding and all his songs are hits that can hype up anyone.

				<div class="box colfive-span2">
						The reason why he is going to blow up because he is barely 16 and blowing up already and he started when he was 15 and that was just last year and rappers that are big started even when they were older than him like Drake, A$AP Rocky, Wiz Khalifa, and Meek Mill.
