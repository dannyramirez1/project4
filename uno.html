					UnoTheActivist is an up-and-coming rapper from Zone 3, Atlanta. He released his debut mixtape, No More T*******, in late 2015, which was followed up by Gift of Gab, a mixtape which was released in early 2016. His third mixtape, Live.Shyne.Die, was released September 2017. Some of Uno’s most common collaborators are: Maxo Kream, Playboi Carti (whom of which he is related to), Trippie Redd and ThouxanbandFauni.

						There's no doubting Uno The Activist vision. When the Atlanta rapper speaks of his goals and the future he has his in hip-hop, he's very matter-of-fact. He knows what he was put here for, even if he's still trying to understand the message he's supposed to share. At 20 years old, Uno's still got time to figure it out. While rap fans likely know him for the Chris French-produced song "What," which he dropped with his cousin Playboi Carti last year, Uno's been releasing music since he was in high school. He began rapping in the ninth grade -- a "nice hobby," as he calls it -- and even formed a group with Carti at one point called TFZ. Once he debuted his first song, "I Doubt It," during his senior year, Uno knew he really had to "go hard" with his music career.

				A year after he graduated high school, the self-proclaimed "young O.G." went to the Art Institute to study audio engineering. School wasn't his thing so he only lasted a semester before calling it quits. Lucky for him, this was around the time he dropped "Parkin' Lot Pimpin'" in 2015, and began getting calls to perform shows outside of Atlanta. Two mixtapes later, and Uno The Activist is proving to be no flash in the pan. His debut tape, No More T*******, released in 2015, had just eight tracks but showcased the fact he was riding his own wave with songs like the Shing-produced "Guiseppe Swag." Gift of Gab, which dropped last year, highlighted his growth across 15 songs featuring collaborations from the likes of Thouxanbanfauni, Playboi Carti, Maxo Kream and MadeinTyo, among others. Uno's versatility is his gift. He dances across the beat with his sing-song delivery on "Runnin Runnin Runnin" and plays no games when he flexes his trigger finger on his song "Whole Thang."

					Since then, he's dropped more than a few loosies and his SoundCloud page is steadily racking up plays. Songs like the Thouxanbanfauni-assisted "Parkin' Lot Pimpin'," "Whole Thang" with Playboi Carti and "Every Since" featuring both have crossed one million streams territory. Looks like they've got a rap trifecta as a team. Now Uno is preparing to drop his next project, Live.Shyne.Die. The effort will reflect his life story and what he's gone through during the past two years -- being shot last October will likely pop up in his rhymes. So what's the message he's trying to send on the new tape? "I'm like saying watch who you keep around you, do what you gotta do 'cause you gonna die so while you live you gotta shine," he tells XXL. "Sometimes I feel like singing, sometimes I feel like rapping. I'm just taking people into my world. All I really wanna do is inspire and motivate."

						The first time I heard of Unotheactivst it was on the song “What” where he raps along his cousin Playboi Carti who hadn’t yet blown up yet with his song “Magnolia.” After listening to “What” I looked more into his music which is where I found many more songs with another artist that is on this list, Thouxanbanfauni, and both of them on a song is like they were made for each other. He isn’t just a hype rapper either because on songs off his album Live.Shyne.Die. you can find a new part of music he is trying to explore. The big reason he is going to blow up is because he is better than Playboi Carti who just uses a bunch of adlibs so if he was able to blow up than, Unotheactivst can definitely blow up.
