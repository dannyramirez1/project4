						David Garcia, known professionally as Ohtrapstar, is an upcoming rapper from the Miami, Florida area. He is best known for his single Choppa. Ohtrapstar is also the cousin of Lil Ominous and trapper Lil Pump. Ohtrapstar takes inspiration from his contemporaries including Famous Dex​, Rich The Kid​, Young Thug​, Chief Keef​, and Lil Ominous.

						The Cuban rapper began making music in December, yet he is already one of the biggest stars to emerge from the Florida scene. His breakout single “Choppa” has already hit an astonishing two million views on Youtube. “Choppa” may not offer nothing new content wise, but it does not need to. The song is catchy and addictive, with references to trap music today (including shoutouts to Trippie Redd), showcasing that he has done his research and understands the rap industry.

					The rapper hails from South Florida and, like many of his contemporaries in the region, has exploded in popularity; building his fanbase through social media antics, utilizing his connections, and most importantly, making interesting music. ohtrapstar does not make genre defying music by any regard, instead he builds upon the formula that has proven to work so well in south Florida.

						His music is fun and upbeat, but the fact that ohtrapstar has managed to figure out how to quickly rise up in popularity with only 13 singles highlights why the South Florida rapper has the making of a superstar. His rap career has not been without controversy, and his hit “Choppa” had fans questioning the legitimacy of his capabilities after it was shown to have incredibly similar lyrics to Comethazine’s “Piped Up.” ohtrapstar is not worried about these allegations and denied ever biting any other rappers. No matter the case, the fact remains that ohtrapstar is a name that will only get bigger in 2018.

					I first found out about Ohtrapstar through his most popular song Choppa even though he doesn’t rhyme to much the production of the beat and the energy he brings to the track is what makes the song stand out and made it so popular and all his songs have that same energy. He could reach the same amount of popularity and heights that Lil Pump has accomplished but, unlike Lil Pump who just ignores his cousins and acts like they don’t exist he will actually acknowledge that they are their and he’ll bring along his cousin Lil Ominous.
