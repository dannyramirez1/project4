				Comethazine has been gaining momentum lately with songs like "Piped Up" and he recently signed a deal with Alamo Records. As some people started to notice, though, "Bands" already had millions more plays than any of the rest of his songs—after only 10 days of its release.The first song that I first heard from Comethazine was Might Cop Me a Jag that was on elevator’s youtube channel and at first it was something completely different that I never heard and the more you listened the more you get used to the music.

					He is not a lyrical rapper but, more of a hype rapper and he uses a lot of ad libs and to many people many people he may be a controversial but, if you could get pass that then you’ll end up listening to him regularly.

					The reason why I think he is going to blow up is because he already had a number 1 hit on soundcloud and is blowing up without having to be very lyrical to blow up like Kendrick Lamar and has a number 1 hit on soundcloud unlike Denzel Curry, Trill Sammy, or Gucci Mane.
