					Denver-based artist ITSOKTOCTRY will be the first to tell you that he’s not a rapper. His dark style is more comparable to that of a rock/hip-hop crossover, though you’ll have trouble finding someone remotely similar to him.

					 ITSOKTOCRY has been exploring the trap rap music by going from classic trap rap patterns, to more pop-oriented auto tuned songs to even experimenting with heavier, metal-influenced sounds crossing over the rap structures. He was part of the Gothboiclique formation, collaborating with the likes of Lil Peep, Yunggoth, and Jimmy V.

				Blending elements of hardcore metal and modern hip-hop, his personable tracks have racked up millions of streams online and simultaneously attracted a dedicated fanbase that’d likely go to war for the red-haired sensation.

					On February 28th ITSOKTOCRY released an eight-track project titled “PASTELGORE,” on which his typical angsty approach was entirely absent. The grungy style had been a staple in all of his previous work, making it a huge risk to switch up the already-perfected formula. The gamble proved to be favorable, as longtime fans and new listeners alike met the project with high praise.

				<div class="box colfive-span2">
					I found out about ITSOKTOCRY through the artist Lil Peep, who sadly passed away and the first song I heard was Ego Death which has a super unique sound which is a mumble rap type delivery but, with his own twist. He is going to blow up because he has a style that no one has or can copy even if someone tried to copy it, it would never be as good. Even if someone like Lil Uzi or Lil Xan tried it wouldn’t be anywhere near as good.
