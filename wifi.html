				When Isaiah Rivera (born March 20th, 1997), better known as Wifisfuneral, was eight or nine years old when he saw the “Mo Money Mo Problems” music video on TV and had a revelation. The young Isaiah looked at his mother and said: “This is what I want to do, like, for the rest of my life.” His father, who wasn’t in his life, had been a freestyle battle rapper in the Bronx. “I used to be mad when he used to call my mom,” Wifi recalls, “cause we wouldn’t have stuff to talk about.” He wrote his first song at sixteen as a kid and rapped it to his father over the phone. “I tried to use it as a gateway to get closer to him,” Wifi says. “But it didn’t work.”

					Fast forward a few years, Wifi and his mom relocated to Palm Beach, Florida. He was originally known as Izzy Kill$ but later chose the name Wifisfuneral after his DJ’s best friend committed suicide. The Wifi part represented his global ambition: “I want the music to be worldwide. I just want people everywhere to listen to it.” After some close calls with drugs. ”I went to the emergency like four times in like a year,” he reveals. Wifi locked in on music, releasing his When Hell Falls project in late January. The artists who inspired him to rap include MF DOOM, Lil Wayne, The Notorious B.I.G., and Eminem.

				A high school dropout whose lyrics are often inspired by struggles with depression and drug abuse, he started Wifisfuneral as a project with Gabe Guerra, aka DJ Scheme. They produced a few streaming hits, including the Brian Eno-sampling "Light Skin Trick Daddy," before Scheme struck out on his own. Rivera released the Wifisfuneral mixtape Black Heart Revenge in the spring of 2016, followed by When Hell Falls in January 2017 before signing with Interscope/ Alamo/ Polydor at the age of 19. They gave Black Heart Revenge an official label release that spring, and another mixtape, Boy Who Cried Wolf, followed in the summer of 2017.

						I found out about Wifisfuneral a little over a year ago because he was apart of xxxtentacion and ski mask the slump god’s rap group from South Florida called Members Only and he was one of the great stand alone artists apart of this group and he could easily blow up as big as xxxtentcion and Ski Mask. He is even better than some of the big name rappers that already blew up, he is hand downs better than Florida artists Lil Pump and Smokepurrp and it’s just a matter of time before he gets the recognition.
