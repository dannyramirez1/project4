					Crash Rarri is from the Southside of Columbus, Ohio. Growing up he listened to a whole lot of Gucci Mane, a lot of Jay-Z and Kanye West. He had been doing music a year and a half from the interview he had done with The Knockturnal in September 21, 2017, which would be 2 whole years now when writing this.

					Starting in the interview that before rapping that  “before I was doing music, I was doing event things like promoting. Throwing parties, just turning up like that, you know, I would DJ and stuff.” His breakout hits are  “What Dey Seem,” “2outh2id3,” and “Used 2.” His website explains his rap style best saying “Merging elements of Chicago drill, Atlanta trap, and Florida’s booming lo-fi SoundCloud stylings, his undeniable knack for catchy hooks and sonic personality sets him apart from the rest.

				Rarri’s ability to seamlessly transition between hard-hitting trap to softer 808-infused ballads is met with his ability to maintain a fine balance between street storytelling and authentic vulnerability.”

					He has received acclaim from his debut mixtapes RARRI 600 and XandyLand, and his most recent, 2OUTH2ID3 WORLDWIDE. The decided to move to Los Angeles last year and it’s clear that he has no plans of slowing down anytime soon.

				<div class="box colfive-span2">
					The reason why I think he is one of the rappers that are going to blow up because only in one year he had 3 hits and not all rappers can say that and he is already has a high potential of making the radio and making a name for himself.
