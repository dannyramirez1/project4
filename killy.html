		<h3>KILLY</h3>
		<br>
					<div class="grid">		

		<div class="box colfive-span2">
					KILLY is a rapper from Toronto, Canada whose melodic, dark, ambient, trap sound is inspired by fellow rapper Travis Scott. KILLY first saw major popularity with his song “Kilimanjaro”, which reached nearly 15 million views on YouTube in a year.

				<div class="box colfive-span2">
					Toronto rapper Killy seemed committed to creating a world all his own, equal parts inviting and sinister. His music, which blended raucous energy and end-of-the-world urgency with the woozy soundscapes of his city, was an instant hit, and has racked up millions of streams.

			<div class="box colfive-span2">
				Killy released his debut project, Surrender Your Soul. The project builds on Killy's ability to ride metallic production with slick flows and melodic bars, creating textures akin to steel sharpening steel. The record includes his hit singles “Kilimanjaro” and “Distance,” as well as impressive new tracks like the pensive “Fireflies,” the electric “No Sad No Bad,” and “Doomsday.”

					Born in a Bajan and Filipino household, KILLY has lived in both Toronto and Vancouver, and over email he tells me how his rap alias was borne from a culture clash in a French-speaking school. Once KILLY started writing raps in grade 7, he didn't stop. A huge inspiration, he says, was hearing Kanye West's "Jesus Walks" on the radio. "I was sitting in the back seat of a car and I never paid attention to the radio but when I heard the first chant of that Kanye track that all changed. I started paying attention to music on a whole different level.

				<div class="box colfive-span2">
					Killy is going to be the next biggest artist out of Canada and he’s not one of those rappers that is always heartbroken like Drake, The Weekend, and Tory Lanez. He has a bunch of hype music that can easily be on the radio and his sound just fits on every song he makes. There is no bigger artist that will come up from Canada than Killy.
