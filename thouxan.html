					Atlanta rapper Thouxanbandfauni is one to watch. After releasing “Heavyweight Champ”, things are starting to go Thouxanbandfauni’s way. He finished 2016 on a strong note: his video “Wish The Worst” has garnered half a million views in less than two months. Thouxanbandfauni’s time is about to come for him to go mainstream and he celebrated MLK Day by releasing a new 13-track tape titled Heavy Weight Champ. Garnering millions of views on SoundCloud, Thouxanbandfauni accompanied it with the epigraph, “Forever in search of truth.”

						However, before rap, Fauni found himself getting "jammed up," as he calls it, as a teen. He resorted to illegal ways to get money for himself, stealing clothes ("Abercrombie & Fitch and some lame stuff like that") from the mall at 15, before getting a job at McDonald's to earn his paper the right way. Then once he was done with McDonald’s it was all about writing rhymes.

				Three years ago, Fauni began taking rap seriously. "Rihanna Wrist," a rattling banger he produced himself, is one of his earliest records on which he pays respect to his mom ("Shoutout to my momma, she raised a young man without no pops") and embraces the positive ("I'm tryna change for the better, I put that on my life"). Since then, he's dropped the 34 EP, For Christ Sake mixtape with Uno The Activist, the Heavyweight Champ tape, a slew of loosies and joint tracks with the likes of Playboi Carti. The sunshiny vibes of "Gorgeous" and warning ode "Who You Testin?" have 1 million and 2 millions streams on SoundCloud, respectively. People are on to Fauni.

					Now, the rapper, who had dreams of being a firefighter as a kid, is crafting his next project, Faith. Chinatown, Milan, DJ Young Kash, StoopidXool and SoMuchSauce are a few of the producers contributing to its sound. The effort is built on the power of belief. "Basically, you always gotta have faith, always gotta believe in yourself," Fauni asserts. "I just want people to know that if you can believe in anything or anyone, you gotta believe in yourself. I got faith. I'ma motivate, I know for a fact. I'm gonna bring hope, give people hope, you feel me? Through when they working or going to school, deciding on what they want to do, the next step in they life. Just take a chance 'cause you got to take a risk."

					Thouxanbanfauni is one of the best hyped Atlanta rappers out right now all his songs are all so good and he always has the catchy upbeat music where it just makes you want to jump up and down. I think that he is better than some of Atlanta rappers that have already blown up like, Rich the Kid, 2 chainz, and Soulja Boy. He could be better than all three of them if he can just have one big hit that can make the radio.
