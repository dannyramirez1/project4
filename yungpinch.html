		<h3>Yung Pinch</h3>

					California rapper and singer Yung Pinch doesn’t come from the usual music hot spots like Los Angeles or the Bay Area—instead Pinch is from Huntington Beach, a city south of L.A. that’s better known for surfing and sunshine than rap music. That isn't stopping his rise though. With a melodic style, sticky hooks, and lots of beach references, Yung Pinch is rising fast and racking up millions of plays. His consistency is also playing a part, as he has been cranking out tracks on his SoundCloud at an impressive pace. Yung Pinch just came off tour with SOB x RBE and OMB Peezy, and he has a lot of momentum going into the second half of 2017. Get familiar with our video above

						Yung Pinch has been building his following through singing and rapping for a while now. The Huntington Beach, Calif. native's consistency has helped him out; last month he dropped the latest edition of his Valentine's Day EP series 4EVERHEARTBROKE3, and he's continued to drop new music every Friday under his #4EverFriday hashtag. His song "Smoke & Drive," featuring Blackbear and P-Lo, has amassed nearly 3 million streams in roughly two months. With his online traction and dedication to making music, things are looking up for Yung Pinch. After dropping several singles, he dropped his first mixtape called 714Ever on SoundCloud​ which has garnered more than 2 million listens. The mixtape was dropped in late 2016. Since the time he released his mixtape, he has earned over a million views from several of his music videos on YouTube​ which were released some time in mid 2016. Many of the music videos were of songs off the mixtape.

						His parents were heavy drug users before Yung Pinch was born, so they were never very good at looking after him. He lived with his grandparents since the time that he was born. When he was 5 years old, he tried to live with his mother, but it did not work out and lived with his grandparents again. Although his grandfather passed away and his parents were not around, Yung Pinch was a responsible teenager. He did well in school, completed assignments, while also looking after his grandmother as she worked 12 hours shifts as a nurse. By the time he was 11 years old, his grandfather died. The experience taught him how to be the man of the house and grow up.

						Yung Pinch is a rapper and a singer at the same time his style is more singing when he’s rapping but, it perfectly suits his huntington beach surfing image and when listening to his music you can tell right away of the Los Angeles, Huntington Beach, and Beach influencing sound. All his songs are amazing and once you listen to one you can;t stop you have to go through all of them and with his voice and his style there's no way he can’t make it to the radio one day. Some people say that he reminds them of Post Malone but, Yung Pinch is way better and has way better and consistent songs then Post Malone and Yung Pinch doesn’t have to use ghost writing like Post Malone uses like on his song RockStar.
