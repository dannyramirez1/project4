						Lil Mosey (born January 25, 2002) is a 16-year-old rapper from Seattle, Washington. He first gained major popularity with his song “Pull Up”, which has gained over 5 million views on YouTube since its release in December of 2017.

					As it may be no surprise how much Elevator has paved the way for artists to break out their region with the likes of Chief Keef to Comethazine to Maxo Kream and more. The list can go on and on when it comes to artists establishing their debut on the site but recently it was an artist who really came out nowhere and has established himself with a footing in the game with his new single that's at a million views in the matter of a month. This being the 15-year-old unknown rising artist, Lil Mosey.

				Scoring a premiere with Elevator, he has excellently pushed his new video, "Pull Up" in a fashion where it has organically caught the ears and eyes of many while effortlessly having a sound that's easy on the listener to rock with. As that may be the strongest single of his due to the crazy visuals that are accompanied by it, one of the standout records that can resonate with new listeners as well song which is a smooth ballad dedicated to his friend Kilo. The delivery is very reminiscent of 24hrs but the subject matter differs with him being younger and going in a different lane with the portrayal of his music.

				<div class="box seven">
					If you scan throughout his Soundcloud, it's a thread of singles that shows you the potential that he carries sonically, now it's just time for him to continue his music in a fashion where he's ready for the next level and not be considered as a microwavable internet sensation for this month or the next. On the contrary, the material that he has released says otherwise but the test of time will tell and Lil Mosey has shown he's ready to conquer whatever 2018 has to offer.

				<div class="box nine">
				 The reason Lil mosey is going to blow up is because he is only 15 and he was born in 2002 which is the same year most of my friends and I was born and while we’re here in school he is touring and selling out shows. He has a huge future with very few songs and each one over 500K plays and he has such a slow and singing voice just like Drake and he is way better than Drake and any artist that sounds like him, for example, KYLE and he can easily be on the radio and be a huge artist at only 15.
