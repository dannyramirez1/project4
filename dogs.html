					Like many fans, I had already heard pieces of the story behind 18-year-old artist 6 Dogs' upbringing before we met—he was homeschooled and raised in a religious household in Georgia, and his mom grounded him when she discovered his music. He persisted, and his unique blend of minimal hip-hop elements, hypnotic deliveries, and dream-like melodies earned him a dedicated and enormous following. Many of his songs have millions of plays, and "Faygo Dreams" has over six million on SoundCloud alone. But throughout his rise over the last year, he's remained an enigma, maintaining distance from the spotlight and holding onto his private lifestyle.

					Growing up, 6 Dogs listened to Christian music due to his religious upbringing. The first rap song he listened to was MC Hammer​ and then started to listen to mainstream rappers such as Lil Wayne, Drake, and Kanye West​ before exploring the underground scene online.​ One of his favorite artists are Key!, Lil Peep​ and Slug Christ​ whose artistic perspective and lyricism 6 Dogs calls ahead of his time.​ 6 Dogs started to take music seriously in the Summer of 2016. "Flossing", the second song he ever released on SoundCloud, became one of his most popular, amassing 3.6 million streams in over a year being released. He credits his success to both his talent and strategic SoundCloud reposts from Nedarb Nagrom​, COLDHART, and Lil Tracy​.

						Amick is not entirely sure how he chose the name 6 Dogs but credits two incidents for it.​ The first is when he was living in North Georgia, a pack of the neighbors dogs would chase him while he was riding a bike. The second and more likely scenario was when he would freestyle with his cousin, he would refer to himself as "6 Dogs" in his bars.​ In 2017, 6 Dogs received considerable buzz for his music and many of his songs have millions of streams on SoundCloud. He is noted for combining trap beats and instrumentals with depressed and emotional lyrics. He has been featured in The Masked Gorilla and Pigeons and Planes​.​ His music videos and songs have premiered on the YouTube channels​ デーモンAstari, global うつ病, ELEVATOR, FADED, and more.6 Dogs has stated that in his music, he doesn't know what he talks about, but sets a broad theme for people to connect the dots.

						I found 6 dogs as a recommendation from a Lil Peep song and that song was Flossing and at the time when I listened to it the song hadn’t even had more than a million views on it yet and now that song has 4 million views. His sound is very different from anyone on this list and no one sounds anything like him and his ability to make a hook is amazing on songs like, Faygo Dreams, Off the Gas, Flossing and Chutup are amazing and if you listened to that song at least once you’d have that hook stuck in your head for the rest of the day. Some people say he sounds like a mix of 2 rappers, 21 Savage and Lil Yachty, who pretty soon 6 dogs will be just as big as them and he is way more talented than the both of them.
