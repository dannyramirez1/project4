			Lil Boii Kantu sounds like a more excited Trippie Redd, but also has his own unique style that lets his own personality shine. This fun and energetic record produced by Rojas is accompanied by a great LOUIEKNOWS visual which really brings the whole piece together on his song Big Wavy.

					The reason why Lil Boii Kantu is going to blow up is because he appeals to so many different genres which allows him to have a bigger fan base, almost like xxxtehnacion who is super diverse and has a big fan base. He has the ability to switch up his flow unlike rappers like J cole, Eminem, and Lil Yachty.
